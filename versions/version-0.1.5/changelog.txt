Changes:
 -Added a special warning at the start of the game, showing up if you don't have DirectX 9.0c installed. It also disables all shaders if you keep playing without it.
 -Huge optimization improvement, now the game launches, restarts and changes language almost instantly (big thanks to [#5865F2]@Tomat[/]!)
 -Slightly increased Demon Baby's range
 -Lil Loki now shoots faster and his horizontal shots travel faster too
 -Changed Deserter's achievement description to make it less vague
 -Spider Mod now only shows health bar of babies that can be attacked directly
 -Frosty now has a smaller attack radius
 -Sanguine Bond, Blanket and Black Bean will only work on babies that were placed/spawned directly by player

Fixes:
 -Removed funny numbers above Mystery egg
 -Charmed enemies are immuned to webs and Juicy Sacks now
 -Fixed shovelling. Now the shops just stop appearing once you've seen every possible item (unless you're missing a charger, then you can buy a token for it anyway)
 -Evil Charm's indicator won't show up for charmed enemies anymore
 -Hallowed Ground's effect now correctly resets for all nearby babies once it was destroyed
 -Fixed interaction between Brain Worm and Multidimensional Baby
 -Lobbed projectiles won't damage nearby enemies on landing if they're charmed
 -Lobbed projectiles won't chase fast-moving targets/targets on minecarts for no reason (needs to be tested)
